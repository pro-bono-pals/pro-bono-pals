  ## Description 
The term "pro bono" is Latin meaning "for the public good." ProBonoPals is just that: made for the public good. This application acts as 
   a matchmaking service for those looking to provide and receive services for the public good. 
  ProBonoPals pairs entry level professionals who want to build their 
  portfolio and volunteer with local community members who need pro bono
   services. This opportunity both benefits the service provider and the service receiver. 
   The service provider gets the opportunity to do good in their community as they network and improve their 
  craft in a low risk environment. The service receiver gets a service they need at no personal cost and they have the opportunity to build relationships with 
 talented goodhearted people
